## NYC 311 Service Requests Analysis and Visualization

311 Service requests are the non-emergency issues encountered by the residents of a city face. Through this project, we want to understand these diverse complaints that are received daily by the different NYC departments. Leveraging the availability of address related features for a raised request in the dataset, we also pinpoint trends within these requests for different neighborhoods in New York City

The analysis and visualization covered as part of the project will yield valuable insights into the overall quality of life and community well-being across different boroughs and neighborhoods in NYC. This information will prove beneficial not only for residents but also for the student community, aiding them in identifying areas with the highest number of complaints (eg. loud noises, rats), or areas in NYC with slow municipal responses to address these complaints. Such insights can be instrumental in making informed decisions, particularly when selecting places to rent.
