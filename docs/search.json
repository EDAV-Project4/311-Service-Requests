    "text": "1.2 Why 311 Service Requests are important?\n311 service requests provide valuable insights into the challenges experienced by the city’s residents. Analyzing trends and patterns in these requests enables local governments to comprehend the prevalent issues within the community. These insights, in turn, become instrumental for urban planning, development strategies, and policy formulation aimed at enhancing community welfare.\nThrough this project, our goal is to pinpoint the most common issues faced by residents across various districts in New York City. This information is particularly invaluable for the student community as it offers a nuanced understanding of the quality of life and community welfare in different districts, aiding informed decisions when renting an apartment."

Park Borough, Park Facility Name, till Created Date, comprise 0% missing values. That increases to 0.7%-3.7% from Address Type to Street Name. These are still in the Good range (&lt;5%, per documentation). For City to Closed Date, the number of missing values rises to 5%-12%, in the OK range (&lt;5% to 40%). For Landmark, this increases to 40%, in the Bad range (&gt;40% to 80% range). For Facility Type, Vehicle Type, Due Date, almost all rows (&gt;93%) have missing values, which is so high that the package parks them under the Remove range (&gt;80%).\nDocumentation: https://rdrr.io/cran/DataExplorer/src/R/plot_missing.r\n\n\nCode\nplot_intro(df)\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly the last 3 bars pertain to missing data values.

There are also no rows that are completely filled.\nBar 5: ~12% of the entire dataset’s cells are empty."
