    "text": "1.2 Why 311 Service Requests are important?\n311 service requests provide valuable insights into the challenges experienced by the city’s residents. Analyzing trends and patterns in these requests enables local governments to comprehend the prevalent issues within the community. These insights, in turn, become instrumental for urban planning, development strategies, and policy formulation aimed at enhancing community welfare.\nThrough this project, our goal is to pinpoint the most common issues faced by residents across various districts in New York City. This information is particularly invaluable for the student community as it offers a nuanced understanding of the quality of life and community welfare in different districts, aiding informed decisions when renting an apartment."
